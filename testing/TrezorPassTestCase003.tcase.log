Welcome to TrezorPass
You have to go through a one-time only initialization step. 
You will be asked 2 questions: a) the name of a file 
where to store the password database and b) a passphrase. 
The passphrase will be used with the Trezor to securely 
encrypt your passwords. If you lose the passphrase you will 
lose access to your password database. 
Do not lose it!
Give a filename where to store the password database? 
Warning: If file exists it will be overwritten. 
Note: There is no shell expansion, so do not use anything like ~, $HOME, $VAR, etc. 

Filename where to store the password database? Ok, the password database will be stored in tcase.pwdb
The passphrase was specified in the comand line, hence no need to ask.
